    <strong class="header">Definition of Cash</strong>
        <p>In layman's term cash simply means money. However, in accounting parlance, it connotes more than money, such as back drafts, checks, and money orders</p>
    <strong class="header">Requirements</strong>
        <p>For cash item to be included in the "Cash and Cash Equivalent" line item in financial statements, specifically statement of financial position, the cash item must be unrestricted cash. That's it, it must be readily
        available in the payment of current obligations and not be subjected to any restrictions </p>
        <p>For example, a cash set aside to be used only for payment of non-current obligation cannot be included in "Cash and Cash Equivalent" because it must be payment for current obligation. The amount you must maintain in a bank account is also an example of restricted cash if such amount is legally restricted (there is a written document stating you cannot withdraw it, doing so will lead to closing of your bank account). This restricted cash must not be included in the "Cash and Cash Equivalent" </p>
    <strong class="header">Cash items included in cash:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li type="a">Cash on hand - This includes undeposited cash or checks received from customers such as customers' checks and money orders </li>
            <li type="a">Cash in bank - This includes demand deposits or checking account and saving deposits which are unrestricted as to withdrawal</li>
            <li type="a">Cash fund - This includes cash fund set aside for current purposes such as payroll fund</li>
        </ul>
